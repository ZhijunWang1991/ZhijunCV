This is a repo to host the (Markdown) source files of my personal website, including my CV, Chinese and English blogs.

*Data visualization*, *chemomentrics* and application of *R/Python/Matlab* is the main content.

I hope to build a good sysmatic refernces bolg for data analysis for academic writing.
