This is the person blog of Zhijun. I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UCD](https://www.ucd.ie).\

My research interest is Food authenticity. The combination of Analysis technology (hyperspectral imaging, isotope analysis, gas mass spectrometry) and Machine learning based on R/Python/Matlab are used to evaluate the linkage of growing conditions and food quality. Here you can find my research [papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Wang-18).\

Data visualization, chemomentrics and application of R/Pthon are my inspiration and nice tool helpful for my PhD.\

Besides of research work, I also enjoyed in education activities for Undergraduate and master courses.\

I have been active as a teaching assistant for many years.\
