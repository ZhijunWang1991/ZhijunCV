### 🍌Research Interest

* Food fraud, food authenticity and safety
* Food quality and instrument analysis
* chemomentrics

### ☕Work experience

* July 2023 - December 2024, Postdoc researcher in Food fraud and digital tech,  University College Dublin, Ireland

### 👩‍🏫Education Background

* 2017-2022, PhD. in Food Fraud, Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands

### 💪Research experience

* **Going bananas (Dutch Top sector Agri & Food project)**: This project aims to develop discrimination models for the geographical origin and organic production of Bananas. Different data sets including the chemical compositions, NIR spectral, stable isotope ratios, hyperspectral images of bananas and rainfall, temperature, and fertilization types of farms were collected and analyzed. The principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and other related Machine Learning algorithms were used to built predicted models. Correlation analysis were also used to build the relations between the chemical compositions and the growing conditions of bananas.

* **Watson Project (EU Horizon project)**: Project management, teamwork, data management; To access the food fraud vulnerability in six different supply chain and  data analysis using Multiple factor analysis (MFA);To build the food fraud early warning system using Use multiple data sources: Historical accident data, social media, and other open data sources;To identify the origin of honey and olive oil using NIR and HSI.

* **Tea polysaccharides**: Extraction, isolation, purification of Tea polysaccharides, structural characterization such as molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, and antioxidant activity evaluation of polysaccharides.

#### ⚒️Hand-in Data Science

* Proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

* Strong knowledge of, and experience with SQL 

* Data analyse and visualization using PowerBI.

* Statistical modelling based on R, Python, SAS and SPSS;

* Version control using Git & Github. (https://github.com/ZhijunWang1991)

* Developed a **R package** named *wagedown*, for writing a PhD thesis at Wageningen University and rendering those files in a PDF format.

* Website design (https://michaelwang.cloud).
