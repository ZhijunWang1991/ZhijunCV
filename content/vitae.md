### Summary

- 🌾 PhD in Food Fraud and Authenticity.

- 👨‍💻 Experiences in lab work such as: spectral analysis, mass spectrometer and data analysis such as regression and classification models.

- 🌏 I believe that digital transformation is one of the trends in building sustainable agricultural systems.

### 👩‍🏫Education Background

* 2017-2022, PhD. in Food Fraud and Authentication, Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands

### 💪Research experience

* **Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** and **Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR)** for geographical origin and organic certification of food

* Multiple mass spectrometry techniques such as **GC-MS**, **ICP-MS**, **IR-MS**, **DART-HR-MS** to explore the compositional characteristics of agricultural products

#### ⚒️Hand-in Data Science

* Statistical analysis based on SAS and SPSS;

* Data visualization and modeling using Python and R;

* Version control using Git. (https://github.com/ZhijunWang1991)

* *Data Visualization* with R/Python: Scatter plot, boxplot, heatmap, etc.

* *Regression modelling*: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, prediction based on regression models.

* *Principal component analysis* (PCA) from computing to visualizations.

* *Classification model*: PLS-DA, ANN, random forest  and other Machine learning algorithms.

* Developed a **R package** named *wagedown*, for writing a PhD thesis at Wageningen University and rendering those files in a PDF format.
