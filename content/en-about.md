My name is Zhijun. I have been working on Food Authenticity projects as PhD Candidate using a variety of Instrument analysis and Programming for over 3+ years. I have a cross-disciplinary background based on food safety, sensors, image analysis, and animal models. I also believe that the combined application of sensors and data science is of great help to traditional science.I don't hold a professional data degree, but do have the passion to enrich my career with data science.
