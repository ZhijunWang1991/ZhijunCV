    Remember, one of the best ways to reinforce your own learning is by explaining something to someone else.

    For optimization purposes, sometimes it is more useful to have a one number summary than studying both specificity and sensitivity. One preferred metric is balanced accuracy. Because specificity and sensitivity are rates, it is more appropriate to compute the harmonic average. In fact, the F1-score, a widely used one-number summary, is the harmonic average of precision and recall. 
Depending on the context, some type of errors are more costly than others. The F1-score can be adapted to weigh specificity and sensitivity differently. 
You can compute the F1-score using the F_meas() function in the caret package.
