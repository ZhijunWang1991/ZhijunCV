<h1>Using R for maps</h1>
<p>Many articles need to use maps to display some data. Professional drawing software such as ARCGIS is more expensive and takes a long time to learn. The advantage of drawing with R is that everyone can install R and R maps have no copyright issues and are easy to use. The main R packages used are <strong>ggplot2</strong>, <strong>sf</strong>, <strong>rnaturalearth</strong>, <strong>rnaturalearthdata</strong>, etc. When you need to modify the picture, you only need to modify the code, which eliminates the cumbersome modification of the picture.</p>
