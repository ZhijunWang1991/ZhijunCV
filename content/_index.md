### Hi there, welcome to my personal website! ðŸ‘‹

This is the personal blog of Zhijun. I am a postdoctoral researcher in food science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie).

My research interest is Food fraud and authenticity. I explored different analysis technologies (Near infrared sensor, Hyperspectral imaging, Isotope analysis, Mass spectrometry, etc) and machine learning algorithm to evaluate the food quality and food supply chain. 

Here you can find my [research papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Wang-18).
